Hi! Welcome to the first Peach Gene Coexpression Network (PeachGCN).

In this website, you will find the data and scripts needed to perform a candidate gene analysis (CGA) using the PeachGCN. The CGA in divided in two steps:
  - First, you will extract from the PeachGCN the neighbors (coexpressing genes) of your gene or genes of interest. This step is performed by neighbors.py, a super simple python script.
  - Second, you will perform a enrichment analysis using the neighbors of your gene or genes of interest using clusterProfiler. This step is even more simple, as you will run it using a R script.
